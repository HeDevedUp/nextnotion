# My Notion

> #### It's a test/challenge project, I built a simple editor like notion which has the ability to Create P, H1, H2, ... text simply by typing / then 1, then typing the text, and hitting enter. You can also select the p, h1, h2,..., h6 option from the list of options that appears when you type `/`.
